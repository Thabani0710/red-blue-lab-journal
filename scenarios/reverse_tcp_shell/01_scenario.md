#  Scenario: Reverse TCP Shell on Windows VM

This scenario is inspired by and adapted from the *JustHacking – ConDef* course. It covers the complete attack lifecycle:

-  Red Team: Execution of a Meterpreter reverse shell using Metasploit
-  Blue Team: Detection logic using Splunk (SPL) and Microsoft Sentinel (KQL)

##  Attack–Detection Lifecycle

| Phase           | Details                                          |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Initial Access  | PowerShell-based delivery of `revshell.exe`      |
| Execution       | Payload runs in GUI user context (explorer.exe) |
| Detection       | Sysmon logs + correlation + Splunk + KQL         |
| Future Work     | Integration with Sentinel analytics              |
