# Adversary Emulation & Detection Engineering Lab Series

This repository began as a collection of red and blue team lab scenarios inspired by and adapted from the *JustHacking – ConDef* course.  
It has since evolved into a broader, hands-on portfolio focused on **adversary emulation**, **detection engineering**, and the **full attack-detection-response lifecycle**.

Detection logic is implemented using tools like **Splunk (SPL)** and **Microsoft Sentinel (KQL)**, with scenarios designed to reflect real-world TTPs.

## About Me

I'm a Senior Network Engineer with over 9 years of experience managing enterprise networks and firewalls (Fortinet, Cisco ASA, Palo Alto, Azure Firewall).  
Certified in **AZ-700**, **SC-200**, **SC-900**, and **BTL1**, I’m currently transitioning into full-time cybersecurity — with a growing focus on detection engineering and threat emulation.
