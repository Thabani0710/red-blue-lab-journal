# JustHacking – ConDef Lab Journey

This repository documents a series of hands-on red and blue team exercises inspired by and adapted from the *JustHacking – ConDef* course. It aims to showcase full attack-detection-response lifecycles, with detection logic implemented in **Splunk (SPL)** and **Microsoft Sentinel (KQL)**.
